# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To make this process the easiest and most efficient it can be, it's important to keep a line of communication open with the user. The users are the ones who know what they want and how they want it to work, so keeping in contact with them helps majorly. User stories allow for a more simple and filtered communication with the user. It allows a good view of who wants it, how they want it done, why it needs to be done, how long it could take, and how important it is. This makes the communication process to be much more simple and streamlined.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In order to start developing programs, it's very important to integrate some of the tools and aspects of agile into your workstream. Agile has helped me understand how each role functions, project management was hard for me, but with agile it more simpler and more efficient. With development, it's important to stay focused and organized. organization helps you work more efficiently and allows you to not get confused, especially if you are working with a team. Agile also allows you to focus on what the client wants and needs instead of having to rush for deadlines. This makes your job easier and the client happier. Agile also helps show what you should focus on, so you don't get overwhelmed. There are many software tools that you can implement to make your process easier, such as JIRA and Azure.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good teammate, you need to be willing to work with your team. If you are not being open and incorporating your team into your work they may feel as if you are ignoring them and leaving them out. You also need to keep the communication open with them, especially with Agile. If not you may cause them to get confused and not understand what's going on with the project. Being competitive is not what you should be doing, it's not about who is better at a certain thing. You should include your whole team as you are all there to help each other. Take and give ideas and feedback to your teammates too, they may have feedback that may fix or improve your work and vice versa.
